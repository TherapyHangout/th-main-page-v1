A lot of people incl. Me are afraid of medicinal drugs. Even more so, than recreational ones they send a shiver down my spine. I don't know, what they do to me. Are they really necessary? I take so many at once, all this chemical stuff can't be good for me, right?

All these questions and fears are creeping into my head and they play right into my anxiety and the circle of thoughts that is fired by my depression. Especially psychotropic medication is a little more tricky than other pills. If a medicine takes the pain away or stops the symptoms of my illness, i feel it. If it stops the progression of it, i can make tests and i can read the results. "But medication that screws with my consciousness or my mind? I f#ck'n don't know if this stops me feeling things, makes me indifferent to love or other emotions and what if it changes me to a point that i don't know myself anymore? And what about my creativity? It is the only thing i have." I know these fears and what they do to you and me and you have to manage these and find answers to those questions for yourself. All i can do is give you some pointers.

## But what if...?

"What if...?", has not just a negative side. "What if these pills are bad for me, but what if they really help me?" To decide what's true is really f#ck'n difficult, if you are as crazy as me, but the good news is, we don't have to decide right away. A good approach is, to try it out. Take a really low dosage, or just half a pill. We can find out if something really helps you, or changes you too much. Most drugs do nothing to your mind when you start with them. Most of them only help you to a point, where they give you a slight edge and therefore the opportunity to make more progress in therapy or with
your exercises you do at home.

But if you really have to take the hard stuff, you never have to do it without the help or control of your doctors. You also can talk to people who are close to you and ask them to tell you, if they see a change for the good, or the bad. Your psychologist, your therapist, your family doctor, your friends or family, it doesn't matter who in your life you ask, all can tell you how they see you. Even you yourself can tell if a change is to
drastic and if the dosage or the medication is not right. There is no reason to be afraid. You might still have respect for them and accept, that some of them could be bad for you, but your change will never be so drastic, that you are not able to feel yourself anymore to a point of no return.

If your afraid you get addicted, ask your doctor otherwise there is no reason not to try something that can really help you. Even if medication is addictive and there are no other options on the market it is sometimes worth a try. It depends on your situation of course, but the goal should always be an improvement of your life, or at least it should help with your therapy.

## Is it really worth it?

I took Venlafaxin for almost a decade. It is an serotonin upper. I know this is not the scientific term for it, but neither am i a doctor nor a pharmacist. This stuff makes you addicted and if you don't take it for a day, you're tripping balls very badly. I took it because none of the other stuff did anything to help me and it had other than the withdrawal, little to no side effects. It didn't make me tired and should help to be more productive during the day. My neurologist wanted me to take it forever and i disagreed with him because the stuff didn't do enough for me. I am not a big drinker, but a beer once in a while would be nice. With these pills though, i couldn't even if i wanted to. So severe was the trip afterwards. After thinking about it i maid the decision to change doctors and the new one gave me a plan which lowered the dose every few weeks and i kicked it forever after that.

All of this could be avoided if i wouldn't take it in the first place. I also wouldn't know if this stuff could help me or not. It was worth a try and the same way i was indecisive for almost a decade about kicking it, the same way you are wasting time not finding out what helps you or not when it comes to mental health. Being mentally ill has a big impact on your life and the people you love. It doesn't have to be like that. There is a lot you can try and a lot to figure out. Don't stress yourself and be kind to yourself about it. It can be overwhelming at the beginning but after a time it gets easier to understand.

At the end it is your decision. But here are some things to think about, while you're making your mind up. First of all, if you have access to therapy and psychotropic drugs, it is a privilege. Most people live in countries where either access to medicine is a luxury dew to lack of health insurance, extreme poverty or metal health isn't even a thing in their world view. So if you have access to it, use it. Secondly if you're thinking about to get well without drugs, in my experience it is something that makes things harder for you and the recovery takes longer. In short, there are a lot of benefits if you try it. But that's just me. You may have a different opinion and i respect that. Whatever you do, i hope you are getting better soon.
