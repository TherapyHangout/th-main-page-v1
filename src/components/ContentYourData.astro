  <h2>Relevant legal bases</h2>
  <p>
    <span>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:</span>
    <br />
    Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of
    which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions
    of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country
    of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases also apply in individual
    cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR):</span>
      <br />{" "}
      The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal
      data for a specific purpose or several specific purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1
        sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR):
      </span>
      <br />
      Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
      subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject
      prior to entering into a contract.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR):
      </span>
      <br />
      Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
      by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden
      by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which
      require protection of personal data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span>National data protection regulations in Germany: </span>
    <br /> In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data
    protection regulations apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act
    on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal
    Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations
    on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing
    of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission
    as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling.
    Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may
    apply.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <span>Note on the validity of the GDPR and Swiss FADP: </span>
    <br />{" "}
    This data protection notice serves to provide information in accordance with
    both the Swiss FADP and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this
    reason, please note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to the broader geographical
    application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms "processing"
    of "personal data", "overriding interest" and "sensitive personal data" used
    in the Swiss DPA, the terms "processing" of "personal data", "legitimate interest"
    and "special categories of data" used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal
    meaning of the terms will continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss
    DPA within the scope of application of the Swiss DPA.
  </p>
  <h2>Security measures</h2>
  <p>
    We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with
    the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the
    implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of
    the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the
    extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order
    to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
    <br /> The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access
    to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, safeguarding availability and
    separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure
    the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data
    threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account
    during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance
    with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through
    data protection-friendly default settings.
  </p>
  <h2>Transmission of personal data</h2>
  <p>
    As part of our processing of personal data, it may be transmitted to other
    bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or
    disclosed to them. The recipients of this data may include, for example,
    service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and
    content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the
    legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or
    agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.
  </p>
  <h2>International data transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country
    (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or
    the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services
    or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies,
    this only takes place in accordance with the legal requirements. If the
    level of data protection in the third country has been recognized by means
    of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the
    data transfer. Otherwise, data will only be transferred if the level of data
    protection is otherwise ensured, in particular through standard contractual
    clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c) GDPR), express consent or in the case of
    contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR). In
    addition, we will inform you of the basis for third country transfers with
    the individual providers from the third country, whereby the adequacy
    decisions take precedence. Information on third country transfers and
    existing adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the
    EU Commission:
    https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=en.
    <br />
    <br />
    EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: As part of the so-called "Data Privacy
    Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the level of data protection
    for certain companies from the USA as secure as part of the adequacy decision
    of 10.07.2023. The list of certified companies and further information on the
    DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.
    As part of the data protection information, we will inform you which service
    providers we use are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.
  </p>
  <h2>General information on data storage and deletion</h2>
  <p>
    We delete personal data that we process in accordance with the statutory
    provisions as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or there is no
    further legal basis for the processing. This applies to cases in which the
    original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer
    required. There are exceptions to this rule if legal obligations or special
    interests require longer storage or archiving of the data. In particular,
    data that must be stored for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage
    is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural
    or legal persons must be archived accordingly. Our data protection
    information contains additional information on the retention and deletion of
    data that applies specifically to certain processing operations. If there is
    more than one indication of the retention period or deletion period for a
    date, the longest period shall always apply. If a period does not expressly
    begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it automatically starts
    at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period
    occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of
    which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the date on which
    the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.
    We only process data that is no longer stored for the originally intended
    purpose, but due to legal requirements or other reasons, for the reasons
    that justify its storage.

    </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Provision of online offer on rented storage space:</span>
      <p>
        For the provision of our online offer, we use storage space, computing
        capacity and software that we rent or otherwise obtain from a
        corresponding server provider (also called "web host"); legal basis:
        Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Collection of access data and log files:</span>
      <p>
        Access to our online offering is logged in the form of so-called "server
        log files". The server log files may include the address and name of the
        web pages and files accessed, date and time of access, data volumes
        transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and
        version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously
        visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.
        The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid
        overloading the servers (especially in the event of abusive attacks,
        so-called DDoS attacks), and to ensure the utilization of the servers
        and their stability; legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1
        sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR). Deletion of data: Log file information is
        stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data
        whose further storage is required for evidentiary purposes is excluded
        from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Sending and hosting emails:</span>
      <p>
        The web hosting services we use also include sending, receiving and
        storing emails. For these purposes, the addresses of the recipients and
        senders as well as other information relating to the sending of e-mails
        (e.g. the providers involved) and the content of the respective e-mails
        are processed. The aforementioned data may also be processed for the
        purpose of detecting SPAM. Please note that e-mails on the Internet are
        generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, emails are encrypted in
        transit, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received
        (unless an end-to-end encryption method is used). We can therefore
        assume no responsibility for the transmission path of the emails between
        the sender and receipt on our server; legal basis: Legitimate interests
        (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

  <p>
    We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in
    this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer
    information about us. We would like to point out that user data may be
    processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for users
    because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce user
    rights. Furthermore, user data within social networks is generally processed
    for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can
    be created based on user behavior and the resulting interests of users. The
    latter may in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and
    outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the
    users. Cookies are therefore generally stored on the user's computer, in
    which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored. In addition, data
    can also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by
    the users (especially if they are members of the respective platforms and
    are logged in there). <br />
    For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the opt-out
    options, please refer to the data protection declarations and information provided
    by the operators of the respective networks. <br />
    In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights,
    we would also like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with
    the providers. Only the latter have access to the user data and can take appropriate
    measures and provide information directly.

  <h2>Plug-ins and embedded functions and content</h2>
  <p>
    We integrate functional and content elements into our online offering that
    are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter
    referred to as "third-party providers"). These may be, for example,
    graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as
    "content"). The integration always requires that the third-party providers
    of this content process the IP address of the user, as they would not be
    able to send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP
    address is therefore required to display this content or function. We
    endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP
    address to deliver the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called
    pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical
    or marketing purposes. Pixel tags can be used to analyze information such as
    visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information
    may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and contain, among other
    things, technical information about the browser and operating system,
    referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our
    online offer, but may also be linked to such information from other sources. <br

    <h4>Notes on legal bases:</h4>
    If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal
    basis for data processing is permission. Otherwise, user data is processed on
    the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical
    and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw
    your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

          Meta, communication and procedural data are categories that contain
          information about the way in which data is processed, transmitted and
          managed. Meta data, also known as data about data, includes
          information that describes the context, origin and structure of other
          data. It can include information on file size, creation date, the
          author of a document and change histories. Communication data records
          the exchange of information between users via various channels, such

          paths they navigate through an application. Usage data can also
          include frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses,
          device information and location data. It is particularly valuable for
          analysing user behaviour, optimizing user experiences, personalizing
          content and improving products or services. In addition, usage data
          plays a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences and potential
