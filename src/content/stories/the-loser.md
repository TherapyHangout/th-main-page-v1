Obviously i have a huge birthmark on my forehead in the shape of an L. Instead of how cute, the doctor said OMG after i was born. My mother told me once i looked like a smaller version of my grandgranddas, who was in his seventies at the time. "Did you see the small crack i had to squish through to get here?, Thanks Mom".
Got out of the hospital, got in a few good years as the eating and pooping first child, first grandchild, first nephew and i lost my status of cuteness to some cuter, cause younger, parasites in my family. I call them cousin and brother. My Mother and my Father lead a loveless Marriage. Three, or four years after my own birth and right after my brother was born they where so emotionally distant from each other, that they didn't even remember why they got married in the first place, but they stayed together, "...for the kids.". That this was only one reason is another tale for another whiny story.

I grew up in a idyllic little place where everybody knows everybodies business. Surrounded by green, tree covered hills, cowshit and fields. If you went on a walk at dusk or dawn u could see the local popuolation of boars and deers with their young robbing what they could eat from the corn or wheat fields. You greet everybody you meet, because you know everybody. We were outside most of the time of my childhood. What an beautiflul place to grow up in. At least on the surface.

When it comes to psychology, they People from this village, even most Members of my family never heard of it, or saw it as witchcraft, practised by lizard people, which are born in alien cows impregnated by satan or smth.
If historians discovered, that they caught hundreds of therapists and drowned and burned them at the stake in the 80's and 90's, i wouldn't be suprised at all.

So there were only two options if you grew up there. Either you make smth out of yourself, or you were a lazy ass loser. Build a House, learn a trade, get married, bunch o' kids. This was a conservative fever dream of the not so roaring 80's there. That my grandma was a church elder didn't help either and even if i am not religious at all today, i grew up religious.

Since im 4, i'm depressed. I didn't know it back then. I didn't know what it was called and didn't even know smth like this existed. Depression, Mental Illness, Anxiety?

Even i was depressed before, i was going through hell when puperty hit. I felt so awkward and ulgy in my own body, that i often just wanted to rip the skin of my flesh and scream an angry scream while doing it. Fat, ulgy, good for nothing looser. My inner voice was yelling at me from dusk to dawn and often from dawn to dusk.
I had to force myself to every little thing i was doing and the only thing that worked was continious repetition. Day to day, same hour, same minute. And i am not talking about large projects like writing a book or building a house. I am talking about washing your face or getting up in the morning for school.
