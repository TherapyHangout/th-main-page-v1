Another senseless killing, another mass murdering suicide-bomber in a concert hall. My thoughts are always with the victims, the families of the victims, the spectators of this horror event.
You see their immediate reaction right there on television. Breaking news and social media will broadcast every bit of this catastrophe live or it will at least be available asap. This will go on for a few days. The stream of Information slows down until it dries out and we and the media move on to the next event.

But everybody involved, everyone who saw what happened right in the moment of the killing, or right after it happened can never unsee this. Dead Bodies, Flying Body Parts, Blood and Pain and believe me, the security, the police and rescue teams and every first row spectator will never be the same again. I call this, "seeing the devil". His face is so ugly and horrific, that it burns itself deep into your memory. You see it often in people who have to live with the experiences of such terrible events. The look into the void when you think that nobody watches you. Your eyes always have this sad undertone no matter the actual emotion in their facial expression. And you saw how brutally honest reality sometimes is and you will never forget. You will never be the same. You learn to live with it, but you can not un-experience it.

This is seeing the devil. The loss of innocence. No more illusions. Jus t the unmasked true and ugly face of reality.
