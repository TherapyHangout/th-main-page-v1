Procrasti-wh√§t? I cannot focus today . Nothing works. Music in the background doesn't help. Does not drown out my thoughts like it used to. I was listening to webdev lessons on youtube earlier. I wanna get my projects foreward and for that i have to learn that shit.
But for a reason beyond my understanding i found it is very important right now and i cannot emphazise the fact enough, that this could not wait any longer, to repair some of the pens i collected over the years. It is a vast collection and very important for the future survival of mankind. I was productive as hell. In the end i broke one and threw away two that were dried out. Perhaps i should have a ceremony or something for their loss but that was too much of a hassle.

So, what did i learn about creating websites you might wonder?
The guys name who made the video is Kevin and ... thats pretty much it. Fuck me, what a waste of time.

I feel frusted as hell. Perhaps writing helps me to get over this funk.
I am listening to logic's last album no pressure, cause logic always calm me down somewhat and on most days at least. I open the document i am writing the raw stories in and start to write.
Sitting comfortably?...Check. Having the cup of tea? ...Check. Top level motivation?...FU can we just do this? ...Check.
I constantly questioning myself. My inner asshole is winning today. U know the one that tells you what a loser you are constantly and that nobody will read this crap. Who on earth is interested in reading about my shitty day? Thats boring as fuck....so he seems to win win today and after an hour i give up feeling badly, unproductive and really really useless....

So whats the answer? How to get through this day? I try a few other things that got really no attention lately like cleaning, washing clothes or clearing out old newspapers and shit. But today nothing feels in any way less than i had failed at life.
Some people might say, "Go outside, take a walk, meet some friends, get some sun" . The big C word is still upon us. The infections are on the rise and going outside is not fun anyway cause i am under constant pressure when i leave the house. It is not stresses me out to be outside so this is generally good advice but i am not living in reality so...

At the end i started playing a game. Videogames to the rescue. Like always i try to dive in into a virtual world to forget the real one for a second. And although it worked a little, i got bored after a while and stopped playing and ended this lowsy day with some junkfood and ice cream and watched documentary about something i already forgot the next morning.

But the shit i feel is not reality at least not all of it. In the end it helps sometimes to be realistic about yourself and the world around you. You know the answer to all of that. The reason i couldn't focus today is my stupid metal illness. I learned a little bit about simple animations in websites and wrote an hole page of one of the stories for my blog. I was doing one round of laundry and cleaned up the dishes from last night. I was not as prodicive that i was in the past, when my illness was a less severe. So in reality i was not a total failure it just feels like that.
But what i feel, is not real. (...i should get a slap in the face for this shitty rhyme). Even while i am writing this i feel like an imposter. Event though i never will be a hemmingway
