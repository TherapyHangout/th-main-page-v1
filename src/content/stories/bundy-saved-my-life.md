I am depressed since i am a little child. I don't remeber a time in my life when i wasn't in a depressive mood and i don't know how many critical situations i had in my life when i just wanted to end it. Not to get attention, not as a cry for help, just to end it.
I tried a few times and i missed. It seems to be another thing that i suck at. Still to this day i am struggeling with my existence and try to figure out how to get more out of this thing i call "my life".
To do that i have to survive somehow and a good strategy for me always was distraction. You have to find out for yourself what works for you. I hope for your sake, that what you choose is not too addictive, because this might add to the problems and not help you. At least not for long. Otherwise it is like always, trial and error.
Sex, Alcohol, Computer Games, Books, Movies, Music, Writing, Painting, you name it.
I tend to stay away from the expensive stuff though. For me it is gaming, books (if i am able to concentrate) combined with movies and tv series.

One of my all time favourites is "Married with Children". Yeah right, that's how old i am. But let me explain. In a world like mine, pain and isolation are always an issue. Every day you have the urge to hide yourself not just in your room or appartment, sometimes even in plain sight. Even though i don't want to be lonely, i hide myself not just that others don't see me, but also to protect them from myself. My moods and hopelessness effect especially people who don't derserve this, who love me , or are close to me. To hide myself i found strategies not to always look sad. I have a mask on. And to endure a crisis and don't look like a sack of depressive lovesongs all the time, i needed something that can also be found in Al Bundy.

Don't worry, this is not a psychotic episode of mine. I mean i still know the difference what's real or not most of the time and i don't see him as an idol. But here is a guy, who lost so many times in life, he couldn't even spell success. He's living in the past, is getting not an ounce of love, or respect from his family and still is going on with everything in his life in spite not even seeing a glimpse of hope on the horizon. And how does he face this dreadful existience? With a fistful of biting sarcasm and cynism.
And exactly this dark sense humor is the essence of my thinking and is what saved my ass noumerous times.
