When i watch a movie, where somebody is admitted to a mental institution, a loony bin, a nut house ..., or whatever you like to call it, i always cringe. It is so far from reality. Moviemakers are often playing with the fear of people that someone could call them crazy, they're thrown into a cell, lose every ounce of credibility and dignity, nobody believes in their sanitiy anymore and they never will get out of this nightmare... and then... a tall indian throws the trashcan through a window and escapes through the night, or smth like that.

All these videogames like Outlast and the like have a similar narrative. It stems from a time over a hundred years ago and even before that, when people didn't know anything about psychotherapy and did horrible things to patients with psychological illnesses and experiments hurt them more than helped. Today through a lot of research we developed much better methods of treatment what's helping you as a patient.
Nobody is forced to stay in there, with the exception of being an immediate danger for yourself or others. In these cases you could be admitted for a shorter period of time and you are constantly evaluated by one or more psychiatrists. The rules of unvoluntarely admission are different in every country. Just look it up on google how it is in your country. You could always fight it in court if it is not justified. At least in a democratic country that is. And believe me, even if i can't imagine what it must be like to live in a country with extreme poverty, or a lack of human rigthts, i feel for you. But this is a different topic for a different time.

When i first came to an psychological ward, i was extremly nervous. The whole procedure of getting admitted (voluntariliy, i should add), was very stressful. You're getting a physical checkup and they ask a ton of questions. I felt extremely alone. I didn' know anybody. But after the first few days i felt better and even befriended some of my fellow crazies. Most of them where normal people. The Communtiy or Therapy Rooms where bright and open. It felt more like a school. But it never lost its old hospital charme. I blame the light blue linoleum floors and the constant smell of disinfectant for that.
Noboy has any interest in keeping you there against your will, because of one simple reason. It is unlikely for you to get better, if u are forced to have therapy. And if you need a more pragmatic reason to believe that, here it is, the longer you are in there, the more money it costs the hospital and therefore the insurance copmany.
There are so many misconceptions about psychological hospitals. If only one person is prevented from treatment, because of the fear, that some of these are true, it is one too many.

It is usually not a happy place, because people who are seeking help in a clinic are not happy and have problems. But it should be a place that protects you and gives you the feeling of not beeing alone with your struggles. A place that shields you from the distraction of the day to day life an gives you the space and time to heal and get better. We are all indioviuals, with individual minds, lifes, likes, dislike and problem. Keep that in mind. This treatment should gives us an indication what can help you. So try everything and stick to the things that help. It is that simple. But it is not easy. It may take a long time until you get better. So don't pressure yourself too much. Don't expect a miracle, or an overnight revocery. You get the time to heal, but healing takes time.

Believe it or not, most people are voluntarily in a mental clinic.
It takes time to heal and hopefully you can get there what you need. I think you should use all the help if you can, because first and foremost it is a privilege. I see everyday in the news, how many people are denied treatment because it is not covered by their health insurance, they can not afford it, or those clinics just simply don't excist in there countries.
There is no reason to be afraid. Hey and if you considering of admitting yourself, you are crazy already anyway ;)) so there's no reason to fear, that somebody could find out. Everybody in your live knows already. end of joke

If you arrive there, you get a psychological and physical checkup. Diagnostics are the main part of the first few days. There are group session in therapy and sessions with the psychiatrist alone. It will be determined what other therapy excercises are best for your physical, or mental condition. Sport, music therapy, arts and crafts, or group expeditions, it depends on what's available in the hosipital you are in. The medicinal staff will always help you, if you need someone to talk, or if certain things are to much for you. The goal is to take pressure away, but to expose you to everyday activities at the same time.
