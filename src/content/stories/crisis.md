I'm in crisis. It is getting harder and harder to do anything. Getting up in the morning is like getting gum out of your hair. It is tidious, fiddely and it doesn't f..in' help if youre inner voice is telling you, "Hey.. why do you want to take it out? You are a loser, a garbage human being and ugly as fck anyway, so leave it, it doesn't matter anyway. ". And people ask why i hate myself. This inner voice is a part of me. This is how i treat myself? I'm an Asshole.

Doing the stuff in my Appartment is also a little bit difficult, if you try very hard to keep yourself getting in a situation, where you just want to kill myself. I am far from lazy when it comes to work , but this whole mental illness shit costs a lot of energy and power.

After you force yourself to get up, brush your teeth, shave, take a shower and dress yourself, it is already the fifth time that day i fought myself through that fat obstacle that is my zero motivation, nothing matters anymore and self loathing mind.

Uphill all the time. In the perfect circle of crap i call my live, it is just fitting that it even my mental illness has some kind of crazy zen. It is the perfect balance of crippelling anxiety and deep depression that if one side is weaker at some time, the other side fills the halfway sane void.

I had a appointment last week at a cardiologist. Nothing serious, but my dad died of a heart attack when he was 49 , so my doc wanted to make sure i don't suffer the same fate as him. I am well aware of the irony of a situation like that." Why not let it happen? The world would not care about it and neither should you". Shut up, asshole-me. If i kick the bucket it is on my own terms or old age. I decided a long time ago, tha i will not kill myself and i hope it stays that way.

On the day of my appointment i had a fearful and sleepless night behind me and to quote somebody from reddit: "I wish i wasn't the guy, that practises what he is going to say to the cardiologist in front of the mirror, before going out" . Not an exact quote, and i don't remeber the OG, but you get the gist.
I have to fight myself to the concrete djungle that is Berlin. It is a cold morning and i am sweating.
Is it my fault, that everybody is watching me, judging me and i am the unwanted center of attention of every person on the street or behind every window i walk by on my way to the subway station?
Cause nothing of this is really there. But this is exactly how my anxiety makes me feel. I power through. The subway is crowded and even worse. Everybody has time here and i try constantly to talk myself down. "Dude, nothing of this is happening. Look around you. Nobody cares about you. Even if somebody is looking, nobody will remeber your face. This is Berlin. Here you can hide in the sea of people"  
The longer i have to wait for an appoinment, the more the mountain of bullshit grows, that i have to overcome. Why it is BS? Because it is all in my head. All of it is not what is happening in reality.
