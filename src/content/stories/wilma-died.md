description: My Bird died last weekend, and i couldn't be sad. Depression often robs you of normal emotions and makes you feel numb. I felt empty and dead inside a little more than usual. After the holidays and my time at home with my family i was mentally exhausted.

## A Different Kind of Bird

Her name was Wilma and i got her together with her mate Otis from a friend, who couldn't take care of them anymore. He moved to Canada and it would have been to much stress for the birds with all the travelling and quarantine and shit. So i adopted them and we had a few good years together. Otis died earlier this year around easter and it was similar to this. Otis was a cool budgie who didn't give a crap about anything. Always happy and telling tales from morning to dusk. He was always answering me, when i was calling him. Not with words, but his own budgie language. He imitated my laugh and i think i could have made him land on my shoulder,or eating out of my hand, but every time he came close to me, Wilma was screaming at him and so he kept his distance. I'm thinking of him once in a while and i miss him.

But Wilma? Wilma was always afraid. afraid of the noise, the wind, her
own shadow. I always had to be careful not to scare her and she only
responded when i was far enough away. When i was complaining about
something on the phone, she started complaining with me. When i was talking
to myself, or yelling at the tv watching sports she was reflecting
me. She was alone after Otis died and i thought about getting another
bird as companion. "It has to be the right one", i thought, and now
it is to late. She died alone and i am angry at myself. She relied on me and i let her down and now i can feel nothing but hate for myself.

## I mean she was just a bird, right?

No. She was more than a bird to me. She was always with me at home these
past years. Keeping me company and reminding me of reality. Believe me, this is very important for someone as crazy as me. Taking care of her every day kept me on a tight schedule. If i was too late to feed her in the morning, she was complaining and calling me. She had the whole kitchen for herself. And i always wanted her to come out of the cage on her own. I opened it up every morning so she could fly around every time she pleases. I created some high up playgrounds with some water and snacks, so she never felt threatened. In all these years she managed to get out of her cage twice. The first time she flew around the room a few times in panic and landed on the floor went straight under the cupboard and hid there until i fished her out to put her on the little platform in front of her cage. The second time she just stood on this platform and went right back in.

## What is "sad enough" ?

Now I'm sitting here and feeling guilty that i am not sad enough about her
demise. She deserves a better human than me, remembering her, but there is no one else. Is there a "sad enough" anyway ? Who is measuring something like this? Is there a Scale for sadness? Do i ask myself these rational questions to have an excuse not to feel guilty? Somebody should write a manual about feelings in general. So we always now, how much is enough, or at least adequate. F#'k, am i dead inside.

I don't know... i could at least feel something, cry a little or so. She would deserve at least this. I'm even listening to sad music. After a few songs i stood up and angrily kicked a cardboard box to death, that was waiting to be taken outside and thrown in the trash. This wasn't working and it was cheating. Even if i felt sad now, was it because of the music, or because i missed Wilma? F#'k that. I hated myself even more and numbed my thoughts with playing some game, accepted my guilt and the fact that i am a emotionless peace of shit.

After a few days, i still felt guilty as F#'k, but then i realized something.
Every time i was walking into the kitchen, i was careful not to disturb her. When i was out somewhere and returning home, i remembered that i had to talk to her, otherwise she would freak out because she was more afraid of strangers. I almost did that even though she was gone now. When i took a shower she was reacting to the running water, or the sound of my electric toothbrush. The TV always made her complain and mumbling in Budgie. In these moments i miss her dearly and in these moments i am sad. I don't know if it is the right amount, but i' m sad about Wilma's death and that's how it should be.
