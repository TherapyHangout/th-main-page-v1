How to describe fear, that doesn't feel like fear? I mean i'm not afraid like having a nightmare, watching a horror movie, or playing outlast or smth. Anxiety is weird and i'd rather be afraid of monsters under my bed. It is like public speaking, the feeling that everyone is watching me. It begins right in front of my house. It is always crowded here. We are in Berlin, so big deal right? But even when nobody is on the street at early sunday morning, i feel watched and judged and it stresses me out. Don't get me wrong, i am not paranoid and i'm not seeing CIA agents behind every window and corner. But for me the Sun feels like an all seeing Spotlight. A giant Eye that always watches me and wants to wwatch me embarass myself.

The weird part is, i know for sure that this is bullshit and nothing of what i feel is in any way anchored in reality or the appropriate amount of physical and psycological reaction for the situation. I mean if i would be an enemy of the state, waiting for the ploice to arrest me anytime, it would be a different story or even if i was somebody who had trauma in the past, all of this would be somewhat explainable and i had a place to start working on it.
One of my best friends works as a cleaner in serveral Houses, businesses and stores. He works at nights or on sundays, when nobody is aroound. He was at least five times the first person on a scene of a break-in and had to call the police and often missed these dudes by minutes. That these close calls left some lasting trauma behind iss something you can grasp.

I tell myself all the time, that nobody cares and in reality nobody does. Everybody is so involved in their own lifes and realities, that they don't pay attention to someone else at all, or they forget you in the very second after they saw you. And for Berlin that is more true than for most other cities. Here pepole don't care, if you are running around in a batman costume, your pyjamas, or being completly naked. The police might care for the last one though.
The mall right next to street of the appartment building i am living in is packed with shoppers everday it is open. I go there there almost every week for groceries. Long lines at the register in the super market are the worst kind of attention for me in general. Everybody has time and nothing's moving. When i finally reach the end of the line, i am drenched in sweat and my stress meter in maxed out. Going to my doctor is somehow worse. I am excited days before the appointment. There is no real reason for me to be that frightend. I was there before, i no what it is like there, i know all the people in this office. I often even know what he is going to say. But i am excited like a virgin on prom night.
The actual day of the appointment it iss even worse. If i can fall asleep the night before after i tried every treatment for insomnia known to men, it is just a few hours of sleep. In the second i wake up , i can't think about anything but the actual appointment. I used to hate to go there in the afternoon or evening beacuse my whole day i was living my own anxiety hell until the visit was over. But even that doesn't matter anymore because it ends my day no matter the time.
If i have it in the morning i am very glad, if i manage to get some groceries before coming home and hyperventialting falling dead in the cushhions of my couch.  
My fears don't have manifestations in reality and are not bound to real events in my life. They are part of my own distorted reality and my views , feelings and core beliefs about myself.How to describe fear, that doesn't feel like fear?
