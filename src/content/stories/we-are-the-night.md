I'm walking the streets alone at night. The city is as quiet as it gets. It never is really quiet and you are never really alone. It is a constant murmuring in the background. The steets are almost empty. Just the occasional stranger here an there and the creatures of the night are busy with themselfs. The wet cold after the strong rain creeps into me. The light of the builduings is mirrored in the water on the ground as the chill air is reflected in the void inside my heart. As i walk along unknown streets, i get a glimpse into the live of others. One is working late, others are with family or friends. The flickering of televisions in a dark room, people sitting aroung a table, or candles burning on a sideboard. And i'm far away from all of them.

It is freezing cold in the shadows but this is where i belong. I'm not like them and they don't understand, don't know what is wrong with me. Don't wanna know or can't. They have their own lifes, their own experiences. Where i am now is where i feel i have to be. The darkness soothes my depression. I wish it would be different, but this is where i belong. Nobody knows me and idon't want nobody to know. Don't want them to judge me and sometimes want them protect them from me and my moods. Life becomes boring when u don't see these little changes in the day to day anymore and u are living in extremes. I am shifting between killing or hiding myself. In the worse periods times between them get shorter. I don't want to die but i don't want to be alive either.
