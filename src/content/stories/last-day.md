description: My Bird died last weekend. And i couldn't be sad.Depression often robs you of normal emotions and makes you feel numb. I felt empty and dead inside a little more than usual. After the holidays and my time at home with my family i was mentally exhausted. And i felt guilty because i didn't mourn her or at least felt sad for a day or two.

I should celebrate. At what ever angle i look at it, i should celebrate. "New Year's Eve" the last day of the year. Society says: "You should celebrate". Welcome the new year
with open arms. Friends and family are together, drinking, eating, dancing, singing or whatever you prefer to do in these last hours of December.

But me, i' m sitting at my desk in my living room and i couldn't care less what others do. I do what i know, i' m writing. I need a different kind of view...

Ok now, it is the end of the holidays. Finally nobody tells me anymore to be jolly and to feel all the love at Christmas. It is easier to write it down, than to actually say it out loud. Christmas is hell when you are alone. It always was and always will be. All holidays
are. I didn't feel any kind of Christmas spirit since i stopped believing into Santa, although for different reasons. But now it is time to celebrate. It is over. A whole year lies in between now and the time i have to endure the next.

It is a new beginning. We start into the new year and can try to make everything better than the year before, hope for better experiences and have time to push all the bad things that happened to us as fat away as we can. I would say, if i had amnesia. I think it was the year before that, or the year before that, or before....almost every year i think something similar. I can not change the past, i know but i have to learn from my mistakes and at least try as hard as i did before.

The usual reaction to the points above is just something like: "You are simply to negative." After i want to reply : "And you are simply a simpleton.." But i am no sociopath and don't even bother to explain, that i am not daft enough to trick myself into putting a fake smile on my face and thinking only positive thoughts will turn me into a happy go lucky person. I know that my view of my world is far to extreme and that don't see the little things anymore that are positive on my way through life. I am aware of these things and nothing ever could change it. Not since i was a child.

At the moment i don't give a f#ck'n fart about new years eve, but it doesn't mean you should too. Perhaps there is a time when i find a way to change things. I will be surrounded by my most favorite people and enjoy their company. But i have to find the way myself. But at the moment i just want to be alone. So do what you want and what is good for you.

Happy
New Year (..honestly!!!)
